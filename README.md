# Overview
In recent years, Shogi (Japanese chess) has been gaining momentum in Japan, and Shogi is being distributed on various video distribution platforms. ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Abema](https://abema.tv/now-on-air/shogi), [Niconico](https://live.nicovideo.jp/), [IGO & SHOGI CHANNEL](https://www.igoshogi.net/), etc.)
Shogi can take up to two days to complete a single game, and viewers can enjoy not only the game but also a wide range of other aspects of the game.
For example, the facial expressions and gestures of the players, the meals they eat, and the traditional Shogi manners.
Among them, Furikoma(piece toss) is also popular.
Furikoma(piece toss) is a formal method of randomly determining the first and second positions in a game of shogi. It is the action of taking five hohei(pawn) on the board, mixing them up, and releasing them.[(Furikoma in the 79th Meijin(Shogi master) match)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsHWH7vo8r8#t=17m10s)
